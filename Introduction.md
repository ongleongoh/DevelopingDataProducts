## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: Edgar Anderson's Iris Data

* <b>Description</b>:  Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken
from
the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI
web site</a>:

<ol>
<li><b>Sepal.Length</b>: Length in centimetres </li>
<li><b>Sepal.Width</b>: Width in centimetres </li>
<li><b>Petal.Length</b>: Length in centimetres </li>
<li><b>Petal.Width</b>: Width in centimetres </li>
<li><b>Species</b>: Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor </li>
